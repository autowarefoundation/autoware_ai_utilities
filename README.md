## Autoware Core/Universe Migration

The Autoware Foundation has decided on the end-of-life date for Autoware.AI by the end of 2022 as [announced in 2020](https://discourse.ros.org/t/end-of-life-dates-for-autoware-ai/13750), and this repository is now archived.

**We have migrated the development of Autoware to Autoware Core/Universe since 2022.**

We strongly recommend to you to migrate to Autoware Core/Universe for future development.

Please check [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) to use latest Autoware.

You can find the new Autoware Documentation [here](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/).
